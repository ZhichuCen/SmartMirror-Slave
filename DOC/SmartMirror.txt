                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "CAN1"      (bean Init_MSCAN_HCS12X)
   - CAN1_Init -This method initializes registers of the CAN module according to this Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "GPIO1"     (bean Init_GPIO_HCS12X)
   - GPIO1_Init -This method initializes registers of the GPIO module according to this Peripheral Initialization settings. 
                Call this method in the user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE 
                automatically; see "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.
